<p class="section-description ">Vancro has worked hard to become a leader in in providing Interpreting services nationwide. We have a   primary focus on federal and govenment Interpreting needs. Always in consideration are our three stakeholders: the requester of services, the people who are utilizing the Interpreters and the Interpreters who are providing the service.  For Vancro to provide exceptional service, each stakeholder is considered. To that end, we have made quality assurance  and customer service integral in our Interpreter provision. This focus sets us apart from other agencies or companies that provide Interpreters. </p>

                    <h4 class="service-title "><a href=" ">Interpreters who are providing the service</a></h4>
                    <p class="service-description ">Vancro is a great company to work for. We are flexible and open to feedback. Most importantly  we honor your terms and conditions.
 If we cannot honor them, we will not offer to provide interpreting services. As an Interpreter working for Vancro, rest assured that our goal is to elevate our profession.  
We hire a local Program Manager to work on-site with the requestors and with local Interpreters at all of our locations.  Vancros executive team is a phone call away. As stated, 
we will not undercut expertise for profit.  Our aim is exceptional service. We will never ask interpreters to sign a non-compete. Vancro feels strongly that non-compete agreements 
do a disservice to the Deaf community and diminishes the autonomy of interpreters as private practitioners.  Rather, we want to be such a great place to work that your first preference is Vancro. </p>

                    <p class="service-description ">Vancro will work with you to secure your preferred Interpreters. 
We understand that preference lends to quality and preserves institutional knowledge that is incredibly valuable in the nuanced work that you do. For on-going requests, 
Vancro will build a roster of highly qualified Interpreters and will check in regularly to ensure that the Interpreting team is fitting your needs. We can provide additional 
training to the staff or to the Interpreting team if requested. Based on your feedback, we will create a Designated Interpreter Team (DIT) that will allow consistency in Interpreter provision. 
For one-time requests, Vancro takes advantage of that same roster to provide exceptional Interpreters. We do not base our model of Interpreter provision on first reply, 
first hired or the least expensive interpreter. We look for quality, content expertise, solid adherence to ethics, and to your Interpreter preference.  </p>

getting exactly what you need. We always have a local Program Manager available to you and our responsibility is to ensure you are receiving the highest quality Interpreters. 
The ASL leadership team personally vets every Interpreter we hire.  We do not subscribe to a plug and play model of Interpreter placement where there is no quality assurance or feedback loop afforded to you.  
If there is something we could be doing differently or better, we want to know.</p>

            <p class="service-description ">
                <p style="margin: 0 0 0px 0 !important; ">My first exposure to ASL was through a friend whose brother was Deaf, and then through the Deaf community in Boston. A graduate of Northeastern University, I now reside in Vermont. I am a working, credentialed interpreter with over 20 years in the field. I am actively involved in the Deaf and Interpreting Communities and have held a variety of positions through the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf affiliate chapters in Massachusetts and in Vermont. Most recently I was the co-chair of the Vermont RID mentorship program and am a current Advisory Council member of Deaf Vermonters Advocacy Service. <br>

In May of 2019 I was hired as the Director of Interpreter Services.  I oversee all of their Sign Language Interpreting contracts nationwide. I am responsible for vetting Interpreters and ensuring that Vancro is providing exceptional service.  Vancro has a very unique approach to procuring Interpreters: One that honors Deaf preference and Interpreter term and conditions while providing excellent service to our requestors.  We are always open to feedback. You can call/ zoom/ or email me anytime. <br>

Vancro is hiring and is a great place to work.  We are growing and we want you to join us!</p>

                <p style="margin: 0 0 0px 0 !important; ">ASL version Coming Soon. <br>

I began learning ASL in college, where I met some of the most amazing and talented people of the local deaf community. They not only supported my education but encouraged my career in Interpreting. Four years later, I graduated from California State University, Northridge and began my career giving back to the Deaf and Interpreting Communities. As a mom of two and an Army wife currently residing in North Carolina, I am a working, Nationally certified interpreter with 8 years in the field.<br>

In September 2019, I was hired as Program Manager for the Fort Bragg ASL contract in Fort Bragg, Nc. Since then, my role has grown, and I currently oversee all the interpreters at Fort Bragg as well as Johnson City Tennessee. I am responsible for vetting interpreters and coordinating schedules. Vancros goal is to honor Deaf preference for each contract as well as local Interpreter terms and rates while providing the best service we possibly can. <br>

Vancro is hiring, and we hope you will join our team!</p>
